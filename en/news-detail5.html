      <h1>HK SFC guideline on the use of valuer</h1>
      <div>
        HK SFC issued opinion on liabilities of valuers in 2017. It stipulated that valuer discloses, circulates or disseminates
        materially false or misleading information, or authorises or is concerned in the disclosure, circulation or
        dissemination of such information may contravene section 277 and 298, which will lead to civil liabilitiy or fine to
        compensate investor's loss. HK SFC pointed out 4 main areas that valuers may commit circulating misleading information.
        They are:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>the valuer knew or should have known that the valuation and/or any of the underlying assumptions is not reasonable;</li>
          <li>the valuer has made an obvious mistake in the valuation;</li>
          <li>the valuer has not exercised the degree of skill and care;</li>
          <li>the valuer has lost independence or impartiality in performing the valuation. For example, the valuer was forced by
          companies to amend key terms and assumptions.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        It does not mean there are no liabilities to directors of enterprises about valuation if enterprises assigned valuation
        work to external valuers. SFC reminds professional parties that they should act independently, and must not place
        unreasonable or undue reliance on each other. SFC statements published in May 2015 and July 2019 emphasize that company
        directors and independent financial advisors bearing responsibilities:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ol class="two">
          <li>When directors decide to appoint a valuer, they must provide all material information likely to affect the valuation as
          part of the instructions to the valuer;</li>
          <li>The directors’ reliance on a valuation report must be reasonable in all the circumstances;</li>
          <li>Directors must carry out independent due diligence regarding the asset or target company; and</li>
          <li>Independent financial advisors can no longer rely solely on the representations made by the directors, their delegates
          or other third parties (eg valuers). They should conduct their reasonableness checking.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>Although appointing a valuer to perform analysis on target assets is not mandatory to Hong Kong listed enterprises, It
      is advantageous that enterprises appoint external valuer to do so as a way of demonstrating independence, faciliating
      SFC's enquiries、preparation of fillings, minizing execution risk. Trinity advisory's independent and experienced team
