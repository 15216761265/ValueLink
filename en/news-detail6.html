      <h1>Unlocking the complexity of convertible preferred shares valuation</h1>
      <div>
      A unicorn is a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. In the past ten years, vigorous development of
      China's new economic industry, the wave of Internet, artificial intelligence, biotechnology have made China to be the
      world’s largest hub for unicorns. While these unicorns are still in loss position, why does the market give them high
      value? The common practice in the primary market is the post-money valuation of the latest round of financing, that is,
      to multiple the price per share of the latest round of financing by the total number of shares of the company, including
      the number of convertible preferred shares, as if converted.
      </div>
      <div>
        Actually, convertible preferred share financings are quite common for start-up companies. Compared with common shares,
        convertible preferred shares have certain priority rights and privileges, such as liquidation rights, redemption rights,
        conversion rights, anti-dilution rights. These rights can provide downward protection for investors, while maintain the
        rights to share the upside potential of the company. Therefore, the assumption of “pro-rata” to infer the equity value
        from the latest financing in the valuation analysis can be misleading and also violate the requirements of accounting
        guidance.
      </div>
      <div>In 2018, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and China Securities Investment Fund Industry
      Association issued the valuation guidelines on private equity respectively. It is critical to analyze the terms of
      convertible preferred shares and adopt reasonable valuation models and assumptions to ensure the accuracy of fair value
      measurement for the companies in process of IPO filing.
      </div>
      <div>The AICPA Practice Aid, Valuation of Portfolio Company Investments of Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds and Other
      Investment Companies and Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, both describe
      three methods of allocating value between preferred and common shares, which include:</div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Option-Pricing Method (“OPM”), to treat the preferred and common shares as European call options on the company’s
          enterprise value. It is a commonly used method for equity allocation;</li>
          <li>Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (“PWERM”), a forward-looking method to consider the value of multiple exit
          scenarios;</li>
          <li>Current Value Method (“CVM”), referred to as “waterfall” method with limited use when a liquidity event is imminent,
          or when the business is at an early stage with no material progress on the company’s business plan.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        The consultants of Trinity Advisory have been working in this area over decade with remarkable credentials in assisting
        unicorns to value convertible preferred shares for financial reporting of IPO filing.
