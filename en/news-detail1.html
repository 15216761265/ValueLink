      <h1>US SEC views on cheap stock issue</h1>

      <div>
        One of usual topics appeared on US SEC comment letters during US IPO process is the cheap stock issue. Of the
        191
        companies that undertook an IPO in 2018, 125, or approximately 65%, received a SEC staff comment letter that
        contained
        at least one cheap stock comment. SEC is concerned about the reliability of stock value estimates. SEC typically
        scrutinizes valuation of stock-based activity in the period 12-18 months prior to the IPO. The authority
        requires
        issuers to disclose the value of the common stock in each ESOP issuance rounds. If the issuers the issued many
        rounds of
        ESOP or performed several rounds of equity financing before IPO, the disclosed value of common shares will form
        a trend
        across time. Consequently, SEC will require explanation on factors leading to the value trend of common stock.
        SEC will
        enquire issuers to compare the value of common stock used in ESOP estimate with issuer's other stock valuations
        for
        purposes such as impairment test, equity financing. They may also reconcile stock valuation with pricing
        discussion with
        underwriters or reconcile the stock valuation to estimated IPO price range.

        SEC’s practice of assessing and issuing cheap stock comments late in the registration process (generally, just
        as the

        one of
        major risks of cheap stock issue is delaying the IPO process when this issue was raised at late stage. To
        mitigate the
        risk, issuer can:

        <ul>
          <li>Issuer should appoint a valuer to conduct a contemporaneous independent valuation. In issuer's disclosure,
            issuer
            should highlight the independence of the valuation consultant.</li>
          <li>Issuer should also discuss their valuation approach in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of
            their IPO
            registration statement.</li>
          <li>Issuer should pro-actively keep in touch with SEC and take a preemptive approach to SEC review by
            submitting a
            stand-alone “cheap stock letter”.</li>
        </ul>
