      <h3 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 5px;">The Introduction of Expected Credit Loss Model for Financial Instrument Impairment</h3>
      <div>
        In July 2014, the IASB issued International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) - Financial Instruments,
        which
        introduced an "expected credit loss" (ECL) framework for the recognition of impairment.
      </div>
      <div>
        The ECL requirements would apply to:
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS
            9 (which
            include debt instruments such as loans, debt securities and trade receivables)</li>
          <li>Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are not accounted for at fair value through
            profit or loss
            under IFRS 9</li>
          <li>Contracts assets under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers</li>
          <li>Lease receivables under IAS 17 Leases</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>The new impairment model is introduced as a forward-looking framework to replace the old IAS 39 incurred loss
        model
        which was widely criticized for not recognizing the credit losses at an early stage and underestimating the
        losses
        especially during economic downturns and financial crisis situations.</div>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">The general approach</h3>
      <div>
        Under the general approach, entities must recognize ECL in three stages on each Balance Sheet date. For credit
        exposures
        where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (i.e., ‘good’
        exposures),
        entities are required to provide for credit losses that result from default events ‘that are possible’ within
        the next
        12-months (a 12- month ECL – Stage 1). For those credit exposures where there has been a significant increase in
        credit
        risk since initial recognition or there is evidence that the exposures are in risk of credit losses, a loss
        allowance is
        required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure irrespective of the timing of the
        default (a
        lifetime ECL – Stages 2 and 3).
      </div>
      <div>The general approach of ECL model should calculate an unbiased and probability weighted amount to be
        presented as
        impairment to book value of financial assets in balance sheet. The ECL formula can be defined as following:
        <div style="width:50%;margin:auto;"><img
          style="width:100%;"
            src="https://shuchun.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/cdn/static/picture/new-detail7-formula.png" alt=""></div>
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div>Where:</div>
      <div>EAD means Exposure at Default</div>
      <div>PD means Probability of Default</div>
      <div>LGD means Loss Given Default</div>
      <div>FLI means Forward Looking Indicator</div>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">The simplified approach</h3>
      <div>
        The simplified approach does not require the tracking of changes in credit risk, but instead requires the
        recognition of
        lifetime ECL at all times. For trade receivables or contract assets that do not contain a significant financing
        component, entities are required to apply the simplified approach. For trade receivables or contract assets that
        do
        contain a significant financing component, and lease receivables, entities have a policy choice to apply the
        simplified
        approach.
      </div>
      <div>The implementation of ECL model relies on statistic models as well as back testing and calibration process.
